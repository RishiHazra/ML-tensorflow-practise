# ML-tensorflow-practise
Summer practise starting from basics of tensorflow.
 Reference: [Chip Huyen]

This repository contains three folders:

* tensorflow basics:
 This folder contains the code to implement basic things like linear regression, logistic regression and convnet on MNIST dataset. It also contains the graphs of tensorboard for implementation of the above.

* LSTM model:
 This folder contains the code to implement character and word level LSTM models for sentence generation. It also contains the code to implement video classification (of a particular motion) using LSTM.

* CNN model:
 This folder contains the code to implement CNN model for classification.
